Labs for COSC 461: Intro to Compilers at UTK

- cexpr - make a scanner and parser using lex and yacc respectively for a calculator based on C integer expressions. It also supports 26 integer variables named after each letter of the alphabet. Expressions include basic arithmetic, parentheses, bitwise operations, shifts, negation, and assignment.

- html2latex - Take a HTML file and translate the HTML tags and
appearance into LaTeX. Once you get a tex file, the program will convert it into a PDF
file.

- nfa2dfa - take a text file representing a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) and translate it into a deterministic finite automaton (DFA)

- csem - read a snippet of C code and convert into LLVM intermediate representation. It should support variables, loops, conditional statements, functions, goto, labels, etc
